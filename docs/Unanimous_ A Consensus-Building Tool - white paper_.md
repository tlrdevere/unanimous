# **Unanimous: A Consensus-Building Tool**

## **Overview**

Unanimous is a consensus-building tool designed to cultivate *unanimity* where it is essential. The platform empowers individuals and groups to collaboratively map out and reconcile differing worldviews through structured reasoning and shared exploration of values, facts, and proposed actions.

This is a new form of social media that emphasizes information, perspective, and rationality instead of identity, ego, and personal flare. Users share ideas and information into a shared map that may diverge into branches but can be reconciled over time into unified maps. Unlike Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram which rely on many-to-many connections between individuals, Unanimous enables many-to-few-to-many connections through **shared worldview maps**, making worldview sharing more structured and efficient.

## **Use Cases & Applications**

Unanimous can be used by a wide range of individuals and groups, including:

* Mass populations and sub-groups (e.g., ideological or political cohorts)

* Community organizations

* Families and households

* Governments and civic institutions

* International coalitions

* Individual users

Key use cases include:

* Policy development

* Strategic decision-making

* Shared understanding and information alignment

* Conflict resolution

* Collaborative learning and planning

* Public consultation or deliberative democracy

## **Core Framework**

The base version of Unanimous is structured around four foundational questions:

1. **What is your vision of our ideal society?** (Goal State)

   * Users describe their ultimate vision for society.

   * This is a values frame. It comes from people's interests, desires, ideals, and morals. However, this frame is not necessarily immutable, as people may develop a better understanding of themselves through worldview sharing and reconciliation. Users may also make assumptions about what must be true to attain their ideal, and those assumptions may change through dialogue and reflection.

2. **What is the current state of our society?** (Status Quo)

   * Users aim to identify objective truths about present and past reality.  
     This frame breaks into three sub-frames:

     * **The Present** (objective current reality)

     * **The History** that led to the present (objective past reality)

     * **The Likely Future** if no action is taken (Bayesian projection)

   * For the objective sub-frames, in cases of limited or unreliable information, users may create multiple possible nodes and assign probabilities. Iterative deductive reasoning can lead to increases in confidence as more of the map is developed.

3. **What action is needed to transform our society from the status quo into the goal state?** (Transformative Action)

   * Users apply Bayesian reasoning to project outcomes of proposed actions.

   * Users can model different paths and estimate the probability of each outcome aligning with the goal state.

4. **How do you believe the world works?** (Worldview Philosophy)

   * This frame captures the underlying principles, perceptions, and philosophical conclusions a user holds about human nature, society, or reality. It addresses the "how" behind one’s interpretation of the world. For example: "Humans have an affinity for truth and justice.

### **User Interface Design**

* Nodes represent views, which can be in any of the four frames. The frame that each node is within is represented by a distinct color.

* When clicking on a node, connections to other nodes are highlighted, and the relationships between those nodes are indicated by connection types:

  * Solid lines: Causal relationships

  * Dashed lines: Generally related ideas

  * Dotted lines: Examples (clicking on a node can reveal examples)

* Digging into a node can reveal:

  * Examples that explain the node

  * Notes from the map author

  * Questions or comments from other users

## **Worldview Maps and Reconciliation**

Each user or group constructs a worldview map using nodes that represent beliefs in the four frames above.

### **Key Characteristics**

* Nodes can be clicked or expanded to reveal deeper layers of information or linked arguments.

* Nodes have unique identifiers and are linked across the first three frames.

* When two or more users' maps are identical, **unanimity** is achieved.

* An instance of Unanimous is a “super-map,” which consists only of unanimous views. For any divergence, the super-map breaks down into sub-maps, and there can be multiple levels of sub-maps. When reconciliation of two sub-maps occurs, they are merged into a higher-level sub-map or the super-map.

### **Reconciliation Process**

Users can reconcile maps iteratively and may include:

* Viewing maps side-by-side or overlaid onto each other

  * In either case, users decide which nodes to reconcile first. It is recommended to begin with the **goal state** frame, though perfect alignment is not necessary before progressing to other frames. The process can be **iterative** and revisited over time.

* Utilizing automatically identified differences using color-coding. This visual differentiation helps users see not only where they disagree, but also where their maps are incomplete or asymmetric.

  * Aligned \= same color

  * Divergent \= e.g., yellow

  * Missing nodes (unaddressed ideas) \= node silhouette

* Starting with the Goal State frame is recommended but not required

* Create new nodes (or notes within nodes) to clarify or respond

* Reference the Philosophy frame to justify reasoning, although connections are not always explicitly drawn from it to the other frames.

* Each frame tends to use a different reconciliation method

  * Status Quo: focuses on fact-checking, sourcing, and aligning on credible sources

  * Transformative Action: relies on theory and historical precedent

  * Goal State: involves introspection and character development

* **Customizability**: While the base version of Unanimous comes with a default set, users can create their own versions. Customization can occur at the level of individual users, collaborative groups, or map templates. Users can create their own versions of the tool, modifying how nodes are defined, interpreted, and styled, as well as establishing internal rules for how ideas are structured and reconciled. This feature enables users to make Unanimous more relevant, engaging, and tailored to their use case. This allows:

  * Specialized maps for different domains or communities (e.g., legal reasoning, ethics debates, scientific modeling)

  * Personal or aesthetic preferences to be expressed visually and structurally

  * Users may customize:

    * Node types (shapes, colors, sizes)

    * How connection lines are styled and what they represent (line types)

    * Rulesets (e.g., binary questions for all nodes)

      * Users may also define their own rulesets—for example, requiring all nodes to answer binary questions—which allows maps to be overlaid more easily, even in cases of divergence. This helps clarify exactly where alignment exists or is absent.

### **Artificial Intelligence Integration**

* AI can assist in summarizing alignments and divergences between worldview maps

* AI could be integrated to suggest which nodes users might prioritize for reconciliation

* AI-powered fact-checking can help validate nodes within the status quo frame and identify inconsistent logic or missing evidence

## **Philosophical Foundations**

Unanimous is built on the belief that rational consensus is essential for successful complex societies. By mapping worldviews in structured, transparent ways, we can reduce polarization, improve cooperation, and move toward a shared vision of our collective future.

## **Challenges**

* Balancing anonymity with prevention of bad-faith actors  
* Ensuring that this tool is not used to push forward lowest-common denominator views, thereby facilitating action that results in undesirable outcomes
